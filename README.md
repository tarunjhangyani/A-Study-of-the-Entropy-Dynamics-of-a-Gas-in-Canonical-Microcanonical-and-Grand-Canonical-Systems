# A-Study-of-the-Entropy-Dynamics-of-a-Gas-in-Canonical-Microcanonical-and-Grand-Canonical-Systems
In this project, a thermodynamic system is studied utilising three alternative statistical mechanics methodologies, namely the Microcanonical, Canonical, and Grandcanonical approaches. Using monte carlo simulation techniques, a system is simulated in this study and its properties are investigated. The system's different attributes, including energy and entropy, are plotted as function of iterations as it is allowed to evolve through time (referred to as iterations in the terminology of Monte Carlo techniques). The plots also assist in demonstrating that a system achieves thermodynamic equilibrium after a significant number of iterations that is (if the system is given enough time).
